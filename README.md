# Quiz App

A simple Python/Flask web app that allows users to create their own quizzes by inputting questions and answers into a form. They can make multiple quizzes, and also edit their quizzes by either adding new questions or deleting questions. Users can also delete entire quizzes.

Users can play the quiz (the app randomly takes 5 questions from the question bank of that particular quiz) and get their results. The app will provide a score and highlight which questions the user gets correct/wrong. The users then have the option to replay the same quiz with a new randomly-generated set of 5 questions, or return to the main page where they can see all their quizzes.
